// Duplicate combined models moved to a legacy package to avoid redeclaration
package com.extrotarget.extropos.domain.model.legacy

// This file used to contain combined domain model declarations. It was
// intentionally moved out of the main `domain.model` package so the
// canonical per-file models (Category.kt, MenuItem.kt, Order.kt, etc.)
// remain the single source of truth. Keep this file empty to preserve
// historical content for reference only.
